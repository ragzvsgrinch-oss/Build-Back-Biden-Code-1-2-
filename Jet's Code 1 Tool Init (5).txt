This immediately came with accusations that Biden stole the election and it also came with congressional gridlock since no party got a majority in the congressional elections. So what's next for Biden? He's got to prove to America that he can lead and that he didn't oust Trump out the White House without a solid agenda to pass. <p> Biden will have many unprecedented challenges head his way that will threaten his reelection chances. Trump will have much to attack Biden on, so he must be careful whatever it takes. Biden must remember it's not just about winning the 2024 election, it's also about restoring the soul of America after a controversial first term from Trump.",
