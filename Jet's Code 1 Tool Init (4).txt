Biden sought to enter office and reinstate the optimism of the 2010s and create a better America. However, there was trouble from the start, some of his agenda couldn't be as strong as he liked it to be which was disappointing to the public. His age started to show fast and his foreign policy was the most controversial foreign policy people had seen from a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson. This election will be a fight for the soul of America and the future of America, but it will also be a fight for Biden. He needs to retain healthy relationships with Jill, Kamala, Obama and his the Democratic Party. Failure to do so will see the democrats lost for more than just another 4 years. Joe might have been in politics for decades but if he cant retain political promises and relationships it's over for him and even Kamala if she wanted to run in 2028. No matter what the world throws at Joe, no matter how much he stumbles he will get back up and fight for America. </p>",

No matter which party people associate themselves with, it's clear to most that Biden has a steady cognitive decline. In events he doesn't know where he's going, he doesn't know what he's saying, he's stumbling over words more than usual and falling everywhere he goes. Even Biden's biggest fans are worried about him campaigning this year, and having to deal with another 4 years in his declining state. More key issues that plague Biden is the fact that after Hamas attacked Israel, his gives his unwavering support to Israel and not the people of Palestine which has hurt his support in the younger base. He's faced criticism for his supposed lack of care for the border and illegal immigrants, and the poor economy which has improved statistically, but many Americans still feel the economy is very bad. He'll have to convince America that another 4 years of Bidenomics, his poor health, his foreign policy and his fairly successful early domestic policies will continue to improve America no matter what his biggest critics say.  </p>",
