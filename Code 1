            "summary": "The 2020 election ended in turmoil with the January 6th riots at the capital and more social unrest within black communities over the long injustices that were reintroduced to the public after the George Floyd murder. Biden sought to enter office and reinstate the optimism of the 2010s and create a better America. However, there was trouble from the start, some of his agenda couldn't be as strong as he liked it to be which was disappointing to the public. His age started to show fast and his foreign policy was the most controversial foreign policy people had seen from a Democrat since Lyndon Johnson. This election will be a fight for the soul of America and the future of America, but it will also be a fight for Biden. He needs to retain healthy relationships with Jill, Kamala, Obama and his the Democratic Party. Failure to do so will see the democrats lost for more than just another 4 years. Joe might have been in politics for decades but if he cant retain political promises and relationships it's over for him and even Kamala if she wanted to run in 2028. No matter what the world throws at Joe, no matter how much he stumbles he will get back up and fight for America. </p>",

Instead, Gaza burns, Ukraine bleeds, protests erupt, and his party fractures, leaving him surrounded by doubt. Every victory feels fragile, every choice weighed by unseen threats. Once, Amtrak Joe steered the nation through plague and upheaval, securing wins on healthcare, jobs, and climate. Now those victories feel distant, drowned out by war abroad and bitter division at home, as uncertainty creeps into every corner of his coalition. Yet he cannot yield, not to the swarm of foes,  not to Kameltoe, not to Dean Phillips, and not to that damned upstart trading on his accomplished father's name. Like a king pressed on every side, Biden braces for the struggle ahead, resolved to see it through until the Lord Himself calls him home. 1968 will not repeat. The end draws near. Only one hill remains.President Biden has carried the staff through storm and trial, while his people wander in dubiety and weariness. Ahead lies the desert, winds howling with voices that seek to scatter the flock. Yet he must press on, for the summit is within reach.</p></div>",
